# Smart-Tagging-Application

This application is an object-based tagging system which can link physical objects to local storage through the use of QR codes, thus providing an augmented view of that object. Once the QR code is linked to the location in storage, various media can be attached so as to expand upon the object itself. Other note-taking and file organization applications perform similar tasks, but lack the object-based linking, and therefore perform only subject-based organization of files in local or cloud storage. This new process essentially gives memory to objects, since they can be updated using the QR connection with various data through the storage application. This project also aims to design an application sequence that is more aligned with human intuition, especially when it comes to object interaction and history.
